# Getting Started With Computer Vision In Python

## installation
I would recommend using the anaconda distribution for this

head to https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/

find the distribution that suits your OS and download and install it on your PC with the environment variables added to your PATH

open up your Python terminal or Command Prompt, ensure you have a stable internet connection then run the following Command:
### `pip install opencv-python`

## or
open the terminal or command prompt where the "requirements.txt" file is present in your terminal's current directory, you can find it in the libraries folder on this repository, then run the following command

### `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 and wait for the pip to install the package. Documentations for opencv library can be found in https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

close the terminal, and open up your Python IDE where the opencv package has been installed to, i would recommend using Spyder or Jupyter Notebook


## Install Dlib and Cmake
install Cmake and dlib desktop application, they are cross platform libraries written in C++ also supported by Python


## Start Working
this repository contains the basic operations centered around reading, displaying and saving images and video files in python using the OpenCv Library, run the files
